# IP Finder Icon Design

This file should contain a PNG icon for the IP Finder Raycast plugin.

## Icon Specifications:
- Size: 512x512 pixels (Raycast will automatically scale it)
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Style: Modern, flat design with clear visibility at small sizes

## Design Concept:
A network/scanning icon with the following elements:
- Network nodes connected by lines (representing network scanning)
- A magnifying glass or radar-like element (representing IP detection)
- IP address numbers (192.168.1.x) in a subtle way
- Blue/teal color scheme (#007AFF or similar)
- Clean, minimalist design that works well at small sizes

## Alternative Design Ideas:
1. **Network Radar**: Circular radar with scanning lines and network nodes
2. **IP Magnifier**: Magnifying glass over network diagram
3. **Network Grid**: Connected dots forming a network pattern
4. **Scan Lines**: Horizontal scanning lines with network elements

## Recommended Tools:
- Figma (free online design tool)
- Sketch
- Adobe Illustrator
- Canva (for simple designs)
- Or use an AI image generator like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion

## Quick Creation Steps:
1. Create a 512x512 canvas
2. Use a blue/teal color palette (#007AFF, #00C7FF, #004499)
3. Design a simple network scanning icon
4. Export as PNG with transparency
5. Save as "command-icon.png" in the project root

The icon should be recognizable and convey the concept of network scanning and IP detection at a glance.
